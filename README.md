<h1>MathsVis</h1>

A project to make so visualisation sofr 2D and 3D linear algebra for the purposes of understadning and learning the concepts, with a view towards game development.

Scenes with examples in 2D and in 3D.

Potential expansion to more generalised maths priciples.

Yeah, I say maths. MathVis just rols off the tongue nicer and might be more discoverable internationally than the *correct* way of saying it.
